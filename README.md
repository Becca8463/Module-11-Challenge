# Module-11-Challenge
The focus of this assignment is web scraping.
In this module challenge I was tasked to Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles as well as Scrape and analyze the Mars weather data.
Through this process I was able to learn how many earth years are in mars years. I was able to analyze the average temperature and pressure on mars.
I was able to use everything I learned in class and our class activities to reference when completing this assignment.
